<!-- 
What are signals?
A signal is a wrapper around a value that notifies interested consumers when that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from primitives to complex data structures.

You read a signal's value by calling its getter function, which allows Angular to track where the signal is used.

Signals may be either writable or read-only. 

signals are reactive like useState in react

<h3>{{count()}}</h3>

<button (click)="count.set(count()+1)" >Increas Value</button>

<h2>{{data()}}</h2>

<button (click)="updataData()">Update Data</button>

<p>Computed Signal</p>
<h3>x = {{x()}}</h3>
<button (click)="x.set(x()+5)">Update X</button>
<h3>x = {{y()}}</h3>
<button (click)="y.set(y()+5)">Update Y</button>

<h2>Z = (x + y) = {{z()}}</h2>
